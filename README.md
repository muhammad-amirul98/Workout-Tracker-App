High-Level System Design for Workout Tracker with E-Commerce
1. Microservices Overview:
Auth Service (Keycloak) → Handles authentication & authorization.
User Service → Manages user profiles, followers, workout stats.
Workout Service → Stores workouts, exercises, and progress tracking.
Social Service → Handles posts, likes, comments, notifications.
Store Service → Manages product catalog, orders, cart.
Payment Service → Handles transactions via Stripe/PayPal.
Notification Service → Sends emails, push notifications (RabbitMQ).
2. Technology Stack:
Backend: Spring Boot (Microservices) with MariaDB.
Frontend: React (TypeScript) with Redux/Zustand.
Messaging: RabbitMQ (for async order processing, notifications).
Authentication: Keycloak (OAuth, JWT-based security).
Database: MariaDB for relational data; Redis for caching.
Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes (optional for scalability).
3. API Communication Flow:
User logs in → Auth Service (Keycloak) issues JWT.
User performs an action (e.g., logs a workout, follows someone).
API request is routed to the appropriate microservice.
If async processing is needed (e.g., order confirmation, notifications), RabbitMQ queues the message.
RabbitMQ consumers (e.g., Notification Service, Order Processing) process the request.
Frontend updates in real-time where needed (WebSockets for social interactions, RabbitMQ for async updates).
4. Database Design (Simplified):
Users Table: id, username, email, password_hash
Workouts Table: id, user_id, name, created_at
Exercises Table: id, workout_id, name, reps, sets, weight
Posts Table: id, user_id, content, created_at
Comments Table: id, post_id, user_id, content, created_at
Products Table: id, name, price, stock_quantity
Orders Table: id, user_id, total_price, status, created_at
Payments Table: id, order_id, user_id, payment_status
5. Security Considerations:
Role-based access control (RBAC) with Keycloak.
Secure API Gateway for routing and authentication.
Data encryption for sensitive info (e.g., passwords, payment details).
6. Deployment Plan:
Local development with Docker.
Production deployment on AWS/GCP (using ECS, Kubernetes, or DigitalOcean).
CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI).
